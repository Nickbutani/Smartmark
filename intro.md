# Welcome to the SMARTMARK Editor!

This is an introductory document to help you get started with Markdown. Here are some basic syntax examples:

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Itâ€™s easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for documentation.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers

Use `#` for main headers, `##` for sub-headers, and so on.

```markdowns
# Main Header
## Sub-header
### Sub-sub-header
```

### Emphasis

- Use *italics* for emphasis by wrapping text in asterisks or underscores.
- Use **bold** for strong emphasis by wrapping text in double asterisks or double underscores.

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

You can create bullet points using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item
```

#### Ordered Lists

You can create numbered lists using numbers followed by periods.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Links

To add links, use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.

```markdown

```

### Images

You can embed images using the same syntax as links, but with an exclamation mark in front.

```markdown
![Alt text for image](image_url.jpg)
```

### Blockquotes

Use the greater than sign (`>`) to create blockquotes.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

### Code Blocks

For inline code, wrap the code in backticks. For larger code blocks, use triple backticks.

```markdown
Inline code: `console.log("Hello World!");`

Code block:
```
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
```

### Horizontal Rule

You can create a horizontal line using three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores.
